## Robotlegs 'Up Down' Navigation Plugin

At the moment the only action that works is 'Up' from the 'Mediator context'

To try this out, just open a RL Mediator instance with a view injected, and type 'CTRL-ALT-PGUP'.
Your matching view should open.

This very early 0.1.3 release is for integration testing. See if it installs without pain for you and please leave me some feedback if it doesn't.
